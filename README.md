# thermostat

This is a web application to manage the thermostat that i'm building on my raspberry pi 2B

It uses only servlets and JSP in order to try to let it as ligth as possible and its build to be able to get future features as domotic-center.

I use a 5' resistive screen to manage the rasp, a DS18S20 sensor to get ambiental temp and a relee to switch on an off the calefactor. The rasp's SO is raspbian.
